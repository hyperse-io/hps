# About Hyperse

## Introduction

Hyperse is an open-source full-stack development suite that provides comprehensive front-end components, architecture patterns, and technical solutions for modern web applications. Built with cutting-edge technologies including `TypeScript`, `GraphQL`, and `Node.js`, Hyperse empowers developers to build scalable, maintainable, and high-performance web applications with ease.

At the heart of Hyperse is **HPS** (Hyperse), a blazing-fast frontend build tool based on Rspack that powers the next generation of web applications. HPS delivers instant startup, lightning-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR), and zero-config deployment, making it the ideal choice for modern web development workflows.

## Technology Stack & Research

Hyperse is built on a modern, type-safe technology stack and actively researches and adopts the latest web technologies:

### Core Technologies

- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across the entire codebase, providing robust developer experience with autocompletion and compile-time error checking
- **GraphQL**: Modern API query language for efficient data fetching and manipulation
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime for building scalable backend services
- **Rspack**: Ultra-fast Rust-based bundler with Webpack-compatible API, delivering Vite-like speed with Webpack's ecosystem compatibility
- **React**: Popular UI library for building component-based user interfaces

### Build & Development Tools

- **Rspack**: Core bundling engine providing 10x faster builds compared to traditional bundlers
- **PostCSS**: Advanced CSS processing with plugin ecosystem
- **TypeScript Compiler**: Fast type checking service for development and CI
- **Module Federation**: Native support for micro-frontend architectures

### Research Areas

Hyperse actively researches and contributes to:

- **Build Performance**: Optimizing bundle sizes, compilation speed, and HMR performance
- **Developer Experience**: Minimal-config defaults, intelligent conventions, and helpful error messages
- **Monorepo Architecture**: Workspace management, package boundaries, and dependency resolution
- **Type Safety**: Advanced TypeScript patterns, type inference, and compile-time guarantees
- **Modern Web Standards**: ES modules, CSS modules, and latest web APIs

## Services

Hyperse provides a comprehensive suite of services through the HPS ecosystem:

### Development Services

- **Development Server**: Fast Rspack-powered dev server with instant HMR and live reload
- **Mock Server**: Integrated API mocking capabilities for frontend development without backend dependencies
- **Type Checking**: Fast TypeScript type checking service for immediate feedback
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Instant updates during development without full page reloads

### Build & Deployment Services

- **Production Builds**: Optimized builds with code-splitting, tree-shaking, and minification
- **Asset Deployment**: One-click deployment to cloud storage providers (e.g., Aliyun OSS)
- **Static Asset Serving**: Efficient serving of static files and assets
- **Module Federation**: Support for scalable micro-frontend architectures

### Developer Tools

- **CLI Tools**: Comprehensive command-line interface for all development workflows
- **Plugin System**: Extensible plugin architecture for custom functionality
- **Workspace Management**: Monorepo support with intelligent package discovery
- **Dependency Management**: Automated dependency updates across workspace packages

## Vision

Hyperse envisions a future where web development is:

- **Fast by Default**: Build tools that are 10x faster, enabling developers to iterate quickly
- **Minimal Configuration**: Sensible defaults that work out of the box, with the ability to customize when needed
- **Type Safe**: Full type safety from development to production, catching errors before they reach users
- **Developer Friendly**: Tools that understand developer intent and provide helpful feedback
- **Community Driven**: Open-source solutions that benefit the entire web development community

Our mission is to empower developers to build the next generation of web applications by providing:

- **Performance**: Ultra-fast build times and instant HMR for productive development
- **Simplicity**: Minimal-config defaults that eliminate setup complexity
- **Flexibility**: Extensible architecture that adapts to any project needs
- **Reliability**: Type-safe, well-tested tools that developers can trust
- **Innovation**: Continuous research and adoption of cutting-edge web technologies
